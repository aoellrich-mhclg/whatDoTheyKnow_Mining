We request the following information. To the best of our knowledge, all relate to changes since the implementation of relevant parts of the Health &amp; Social Care Act 2012 and subsequent legislation, policy and guidance:-

(1) copies of information and guidance issued to individual Directors of Public Health, on the role if any, which they (a) could and should and (b) must play, in connection with planning applications which threaten the very survival of services, designed to protect and promote health and wellbeing, e.g. planning applications which risk causing or exacerbating disabling anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and urges;

(2) whether in relation to (1) above, Directors of Public Health have been advised that they should not or must not advise Local Planning Authorities on planning applications that threaten the very survival of small scale services, which might only protect and promote the health of a few dozen or few hundred people, rather than hundreds of thousands;

(3) copies of information and guidance issued to any Local Planning Authorities, on circumstances when they could, should and must reject planning applications, in order to protect and promote mental and physical health, e.g. so as not to exacerbate disabling anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and urges;

(4) copies of information and guidance issued to the Planning Inspectorate, in connection with the protection and promotion of health and wellbeing, through all of its decision making processes.

Background Information

Local authorities now have public health functions, which were transferred from the NHS.. Where there are county councils with borough councils in the same areas, the former appear responsible for public health functions. If so, that cannot mean, that Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) within those borough councils, can apply lower public health standards. 

All LPAs across the board, must apply the same standards and be confident that those would be endorsed by the Planning Inspectorate, when it has to judge draft Local Plans and planning appeals.

The points below from national policies, are about ensuring the planning system is used to protect and promote health and wellbeing, by empowering individuals and groups to protect their own health in innovative ways, through encouraging and sustaining innovative local service developments. 

There is no call from the government to do the very opposite but that is happening, because of uncertainties about when planners could and should decline to give planning permissions.

In December 2011, the Department of Health &amp; Social Care (DHSC) stated in &#39;Public health in local government&#39; that local authorities:-

a) &quot;can fulfil [their public health] duty in a wide range of ways, including the way they operate the planning system&quot;. The word &quot;can&quot; sounds optional and may be the cause of uncertainty and even fear in the minds of some planners and LPAs;

b) must include &quot;health in all policies&quot; which must include not only explicit policies within Local Plans but also the way planning decisions are processed and decided;

c)  must, &quot;put health and wellbeing at the heart of everything they do&quot;. Taken literally, &quot;everything&quot; must include the ways in which planning applications are considered and whether or not they should be approved;

d) must seek, &quot;the most health benefit&quot; in all decisions taken, which rules out granting planning permissions which would knowingly harm health and wellbeing. However, it seems to us that LPAs may not be confident that such decisions would be upheld by the Planning Inspectorate, when deciding appeals. LPAs may be fearful of having costs award against them, if they decline to grant planning permissions in order to protect and promote health. By contrast, they are not subjected to financial or any other penalties, when granting planning permissions which knowingly harm health. Thus the scales seem inadvertently tipped in favour of encouraging LPAs to harm health, because of their tight budget constraints. Those who would need to resort to Judicial Reviews do not have the many resources and deep pockets of developers;

e) must &quot;ensure the health needs of ... vulnerable groups are addressed&quot;;

f) have a &quot;leadership role in tackling the causes of ill-health and ... promoting and protecting health&quot;. LPAs may be uncertain about taking a leadership role. As one planner stated off the record, &quot;planning laws and policies are way behind current thinking on the protection and promotion of health and it is likely to be a very long time before they catch up&quot;. Even if the government sees that as a misunderstanding, if it is typical of thinking among planners and LPAs., it does not bode well for health in the here and now;

g) are expected, &quot;to use all the tools at [their] disposal in a new way&quot; to fulfil their duty in connection with health. Taken literally, &quot;all&quot; must include planning policies and decision making;

h) are expected to foster and promote local service innovation. The very opposite is the result, when innovation is seriously compromised or subverted by harmful planning permissions;

i) have the, &quot;freedom to innovate and respond to service user need [which will] drive up quality and improve health outcomes&quot;;

j) are expected to &quot;increase the number of service providers&quot; in order &quot;to drive up quality&quot;. The very opposite is achieved, when planning permissions unwittingly compromise and undermine alternative and innovative public services;

k) are expected to &quot;empower individuals&quot; as a means of protecting and promoting their health. That inevitably includes ensuring they have a wider range of choices in the services they use and not forcing them to suffer Hobson&#39;s choice. That is reinforced by the 2014 Care Act, which requires that needs be met but not by forcing acceptance of traditional and limited services on a take-it-or-leave-it basis;

l) are expected to promote, &quot;community ... engagement [and the] development of social networks&quot;. Unwittingly forcing the erosion or even breakdown of those, would not be acceptable at planning appeals.

m) are encouraged to seek advice from Directors of Public Health in order to &quot;build healthier communities. [They] will need to ... influence and support colleagues who have a key role in creating better health, such as planning officers&quot;. Our Director of Public Health has responded urgently and sensitively to our concerns. However, he sees his role and that of his team, as being confined to large scale policy matters, which concern &quot;the overall health and wellbeing of the whole population&quot; and not threats to the health of individuals, small groups and public services on a smaller scale.

n) are expected to &quot;Tailor services to individual needs&quot; and not a take-it-or-leave it approach to conventional services.

In connection with health, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) states in the National Planning Policy Framework:- 

o) planning permissions should be granted unless, &quot;any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole&quot;. We have gained the impression that planners are not convinced that the word &quot;any&quot; can be decisive, in terms of the protection of health and wellbeing. It is inevitable, that the notion of taking policies &quot;as a whole&quot;, must include all other relevant national polices as outlined in connection with this FoI request. If not, those additional national policies would be superfluous, serve no useful purpose and civil servants would have wasted their time and public funds, on drafting and issuing additional national policies of direct relevance;

p) the NPPF encourages LPAs to engage with relevant organisations to ensure, &quot;the provision of the required health infrastructure&quot; and that it be protected, &quot;when determining planning applications&quot;.

The MHCLG issued in 2014, &#39;The role of health and wellbeing in planning&#39;. That states:-

p)  &quot;Local planning authorities should ensure that health and wellbeing and health infrastructure are considered in ... planning decision making ... in order to ... support appropriate health infrastructure&quot;. That rules out planning decisions which undermine the local health infrastructure and undermine the government&#39;s call for the innovations referred to above, especially nationally acclaimed innovations;

q) &quot;natural environments are major determinants of health and wellbeing&quot; so degrading and destroying those with planning decisions, ipso facto imposes threats to health, especially when they have been formally selected and managed for mental health protection;

r) &quot;Local authority planners should consider consulting the Director of Public Health on any planning applications (including at the pre-application stage) that are likely to have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of ... particular groups ...&quot;. As mentioned under m) above, our Director of Public Health does not see this as a legitimate use of his time and that of his team. Therefore, further national guidance would be useful, e.g. suggesting other ways in which planners could obtain sound information on protecting and promoting health and wellbeing, which might include consultations with members of the Health &amp; Care Professions Council and others with relevant qualifications;

s) health impact assessments are recommended when there may be significant impacts but who should conduct those and how they should do so, may not be clear;

t) &quot;the views of the local Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS England should be sought regarding the impact of new development which would have a significant or cumulatively significant effect on health infrastructure and/or the demand for healthcare services&quot;. In view of the details above under m) and r), it would be helpful to clarify whether this is intended to include seriously harmful impacts on a few individuals or a few hundreds or only many thousands. 

Summary of Issues

Seven  years since the Health &amp; Social Care Act 2012, there is a pressing need for LPAs to have not only clearer but concise national guidance, on the way the planning system should work, in connection with the protection and promotion of health. Without greater clarity, health will remain acutely threatened by some planning permissions, as we have discovered to our cost. Our nationally acclaimed pioneering bereavement work is under very serious threat. The cumulative impacts are horrendous. Previous objections by health and welfare staff both active and retired have carried no weight. We recently discovered that the Director of Public Health has no role to play.

It appears that a significant proportion of damaging and destructive planning permissions are being granted, because LPAs which do not have Local Plans, believe the government requires them to build houses almost anywhere and everywhere and if they do not, they will suffer the consequences at planning appeals. That seems the case, even when a Planning Inspector has said there is a &quot;considerable oversupply&quot; of sites for new houses. 

We have gained the impression that our LPA is not sure whether the protection of health and wellbeing, is sufficient to justify refusals of planning applications.

Some planning permissions are being granted, because LPAs faced with declining budgets, fear refusals will results in considerable costs in defending appeals. Consequently, many of those we have helped to cope with bereavements, raised £100,000 to enable Harrogate Borough Council to defend an appeal, if a seriously threatening planning application is refused. However, that defence fund has been returned, because the Chief Executive claims the local authority is able to raise sufficient funds when &quot;necessary&quot;. That may mean not defending some appeals and allowing them to be won by default. If so, the refusal of planning applications on that basis, would amount to a very clear sign of LPAs having lost control, when the NPPF refers to returning control to local people and making the planning system easy for them to understand. It has probably never been more complex and confusing. It even appears that local councillors can no longer represent the interests of local people,  especially when faced with the imbalance of developers with deep pockets.

  <p><p>AB WELFARE &amp; WILDLIFE TRUST</p>

<p>Dear MHCLG.,</p>

<p>We request the following information. To the best of our knowledge, all relate to changes since the implementation of relevant parts of the Health &amp; Social Care Act 2012 and subsequent legislation, policy and guidance:-</p>

<p>(1) copies of information and guidance issued to individual Directors of Public Health, on the role if any, which they (a) could and should and (b) must play, in connection with planning applications which threaten the very survival of services, designed to protect and promote health and wellbeing, e.g. planning applications which risk causing or exacerbating disabling anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and urges;</p>

<p>(2) whether in relation to (1) above, Directors of Public Health have been advised that they should not or must not advise Local Planning Authorities on planning applications that threaten the very survival of small scale services, which might only protect and promote the health of a few dozen or few hundred people, rather than hundreds of thousands;</p>

<p>(3) copies of information and guidance issued to any Local Planning Authorities, on circumstances when they could, should and must reject planning applications, in order to protect and promote mental and physical health, e.g. so as not to exacerbate disabling anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts and urges;</p>

<p>(4) copies of information and guidance issued to the Planning Inspectorate, in connection with the protection and promotion of health and wellbeing, through all of its decision making processes.</p>

<p>Background Information</p>

<p>Local authorities now have public health functions, which were transferred from the NHS.. Where there are county councils with borough councils in the same areas, the former appear responsible for public health functions. If so, that cannot mean, that Local Planning Authorities (LPAs) within those borough councils, can apply lower public health standards. </p>

<p>All LPAs across the board, must apply the same standards and be confident that those would be endorsed by the Planning Inspectorate, when it has to judge draft Local Plans and planning appeals.</p>

<p>The points below from national policies, are about ensuring the planning system is used to protect and promote health and wellbeing, by empowering individuals and groups to protect their own health in innovative ways, through encouraging and sustaining innovative local service developments. </p>

<p>There is no call from the government to do the very opposite but that is happening, because of uncertainties about when planners could and should decline to give planning permissions.</p>

<p>In December 2011, the Department of Health &amp; Social Care (DHSC) stated in 'Public health in local government' that local authorities:-</p>

<p>a) "can fulfil [their public health] duty in a wide range of ways, including the way they operate the planning system". The word "can" sounds optional and may be the cause of uncertainty and even fear in the minds of some planners and LPAs;</p>

<p>b) must include "health in all policies" which must include not only explicit policies within Local Plans but also the way planning decisions are processed and decided;</p>

<p>c)  must, "put health and wellbeing at the heart of everything they do". Taken literally, "everything" must include the ways in which planning applications are considered and whether or not they should be approved;</p>

<p>d) must seek, "the most health benefit" in all decisions taken, which rules out granting planning permissions which would knowingly harm health and wellbeing. However, it seems to us that LPAs may not be confident that such decisions would be upheld by the Planning Inspectorate, when deciding appeals. LPAs may be fearful of having costs award against them, if they decline to grant planning permissions in order to protect and promote health. By contrast, they are not subjected to financial or any other penalties, when granting planning permissions which knowingly harm health. Thus the scales seem inadvertently tipped in favour of encouraging LPAs to harm health, because of their tight budget constraints. Those who would need to resort to Judicial Reviews do not have the many resources and deep pockets of developers;</p>

<p>e) must "ensure the health needs of ... vulnerable groups are addressed";</p>

<p>f) have a "leadership role in tackling the causes of ill-health and ... promoting and protecting health". LPAs may be uncertain about taking a leadership role. As one planner stated off the record, "planning laws and policies are way behind current thinking on the protection and promotion of health and it is likely to be a very long time before they catch up". Even if the government sees that as a misunderstanding, if it is typical of thinking among planners and LPAs., it does not bode well for health in the here and now;</p>

<p>g) are expected, "to use all the tools at [their] disposal in a new way" to fulfil their duty in connection with health. Taken literally, "all" must include planning policies and decision making;</p>

<p>h) are expected to foster and promote local service innovation. The very opposite is the result, when innovation is seriously compromised or subverted by harmful planning permissions;</p>

<p>i) have the, "freedom to innovate and respond to service user need [which will] drive up quality and improve health outcomes";</p>

<p>j) are expected to "increase the number of service providers" in order "to drive up quality". The very opposite is achieved, when planning permissions unwittingly compromise and undermine alternative and innovative public services;</p>

<p>k) are expected to "empower individuals" as a means of protecting and promoting their health. That inevitably includes ensuring they have a wider range of choices in the services they use and not forcing them to suffer Hobson's choice. That is reinforced by the 2014 Care Act, which requires that needs be met but not by forcing acceptance of traditional and limited services on a take-it-or-leave-it basis;</p>

<p>l) are expected to promote, "community ... engagement [and the] development of social networks". Unwittingly forcing the erosion or even breakdown of those, would not be acceptable at planning appeals.</p>

<p>m) are encouraged to seek advice from Directors of Public Health in order to "build healthier communities. [They] will need to ... influence and support colleagues who have a key role in creating better health, such as planning officers". Our Director of Public Health has responded urgently and sensitively to our concerns. However, he sees his role and that of his team, as being confined to large scale policy matters, which concern "the overall health and wellbeing of the whole population" and not threats to the health of individuals, small groups and public services on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>n) are expected to "Tailor services to individual needs" and not a take-it-or-leave it approach to conventional services.</p>

<p>In connection with health, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) states in the National Planning Policy Framework:- </p>

<p>o) planning permissions should be granted unless, "any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole". We have gained the impression that planners are not convinced that the word "any" can be decisive, in terms of the protection of health and wellbeing. It is inevitable, that the notion of taking policies "as a whole", must include all other relevant national polices as outlined in connection with this FoI request. If not, those additional national policies would be superfluous, serve no useful purpose and civil servants would have wasted their time and public funds, on drafting and issuing additional national policies of direct relevance;</p>

<p>p) the NPPF encourages LPAs to engage with relevant organisations to ensure, "the provision of the required health infrastructure" and that it be protected, "when determining planning applications".</p>

<p>The MHCLG issued in 2014, 'The role of health and wellbeing in planning'. That states:-</p>

<p>p)  "Local planning authorities should ensure that health and wellbeing and health infrastructure are considered in ... planning decision making ... in order to ... support appropriate health infrastructure". That rules out planning decisions which undermine the local health infrastructure and undermine the government's call for the innovations referred to above, especially nationally acclaimed innovations;</p>

<p>q) "natural environments are major determinants of health and wellbeing" so degrading and destroying those with planning decisions, ipso facto imposes threats to health, especially when they have been formally selected and managed for mental health protection;</p>

<p>r) "Local authority planners should consider consulting the Director of Public Health on any planning applications (including at the pre-application stage) that are likely to have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of ... particular groups ...". As mentioned under m) above, our Director of Public Health does not see this as a legitimate use of his time and that of his team. Therefore, further national guidance would be useful, e.g. suggesting other ways in which planners could obtain sound information on protecting and promoting health and wellbeing, which might include consultations with members of the Health &amp; Care Professions Council and others with relevant qualifications;</p>

<p>s) health impact assessments are recommended when there may be significant impacts but who should conduct those and how they should do so, may not be clear;</p>

<p>t) "the views of the local Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS England should be sought regarding the impact of new development which would have a significant or cumulatively significant effect on health infrastructure and/or the demand for healthcare services". In view of the details above under m) and r), it would be helpful to clarify whether this is intended to include seriously harmful impacts on a few individuals or a few hundreds or only many thousands. </p>

<p>Summary of Issues</p>

<p>Seven  years since the Health &amp; Social Care Act 2012, there is a pressing need for LPAs to have not only clearer but concise national guidance, on the way the planning system should work, in connection with the protection and promotion of health. Without greater clarity, health will remain acutely threatened by some planning permissions, as we have discovered to our cost. Our nationally acclaimed pioneering bereavement work is under very serious threat. The cumulative impacts are horrendous. Previous objections by health and welfare staff both active and retired have carried no weight. We recently discovered that the Director of Public Health has no role to play.</p>

<p>It appears that a significant proportion of damaging and destructive planning permissions are being granted, because LPAs which do not have Local Plans, believe the government requires them to build houses almost anywhere and everywhere and if they do not, they will suffer the consequences at planning appeals. That seems the case, even when a Planning Inspector has said there is a "considerable oversupply" of sites for new houses. </p>

<p>We have gained the impression that our LPA is not sure whether the protection of health and wellbeing, is sufficient to justify refusals of planning applications.</p>

<p>Some planning permissions are being granted, because LPAs faced with declining budgets, fear refusals will results in considerable costs in defending appeals. Consequently, many of those we have helped to cope with bereavements, raised £100,000 to enable Harrogate Borough Council to defend an appeal, if a seriously threatening planning application is refused. However, that defence fund has been returned, because the Chief Executive claims the local authority is able to raise sufficient funds when "necessary". That may mean not defending some appeals and allowing them to be won by default. If so, the refusal of planning applications on that basis, would amount to a very clear sign of LPAs having lost control, when the NPPF refers to returning control to local people and making the planning system easy for them to understand. It has probably never been more complex and confusing. It even appears that local councillors can no longer represent the interests of local people,  especially when faced with the imbalance of developers with deep pockets.</p>
